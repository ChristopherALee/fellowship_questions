// Question 3 -- changePossibilities(amount,amount): Your quirky boss collects rare, old coins. They found out you're a programmer and asked you to solve something they've been wondering for a long time.

// Write a function that, given an amount of money and an array of coin denominations, computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

// Example: for amount=4 (4¢) and denominations=[1,2,3] (1¢, 2¢ and 3¢), your program would output 4—the number of ways to make 4¢ with those denominations:

// 1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
// 1¢, 1¢, 2¢
// 1¢, 3¢
// 2¢, 2¢

const changePossibilities = (amount, coinDenom) => {
  let possibilities = [];

  for (let i = 0; i <= amount; i++) {
    possibilities[i] = 0;
  }

  possibilities[0] = 1;

  for (let j = 0; j < coinDenom.length; j++) {
    let currentCoin = coinDenom[j];

    for (
      let accruedValue = currentCoin;
      accruedValue <= amount;
      accruedValue++
    ) {
      let delta = accruedValue - currentCoin;

      possibilities[accruedValue] += possibilities[delta];
    }
  }

  return possibilities[amount];
};

changePossibilities(4, [1, 2, 3]);
